*It wasn’t just the logo that attracted me to NestJS, I wanted to learn how to build a structured and scalable backend after experiencing the challenges of poorly designed APIs as a frontend developer*

**Project**: A simple REST API built with **NestJS** to practice core backend concepts.

## What I’ve Learned

- **Modules** – Organize application structure and group related controllers and providers.
- **Controllers** – Handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
- **Services (Providers)** – Contain business logic and are injected into controllers.
- **Dependency Injection** – Nest automatically provides service instances where needed.
- **Unit Testing** – Testing controllers using mocked services with Jest.
- **Error Handling** – Using NestJS exceptions to return proper HTTP error responses. 
- **Pipes** - Validate and transform inputs, runs before the controller
